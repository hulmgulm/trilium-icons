It uses the English default emoji descriptions from [this page](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). It uses the `emojis` prefix.

See the TriliumNext documentation about [how to install the icon pack](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/concepts/themes/icon-packs).

The font included is the [Google Noto Color Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/tree/main/fonts) font v2.051, distributed by Google under the [SIL Open Font License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/refs/heads/main/fonts/LICENSE).

In the tools directory, you can find a nodejs script, which was used to create the manifest for this icon pack.
